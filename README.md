### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: What Factors may Affect Voters’ Choices
+ This project is conducted by Yuwei Tong.

+ Project summary: The 2020 United States presidential election will be held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020, and a new president will be elected between Donald Trump for the Republicans and Joe Biden for the Democrats. In this project, I used the results of 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey and tried to find factors that may affect people's voting choices. I analyzed the responses to several questions, and found  Trump supporters and Biden supporters have quite different opinions on the following topics:
    - Party identity
    - Values and ideological orientations
    - Feelings towards Trump and his work  

These may be the factors that affect their voting choices.
